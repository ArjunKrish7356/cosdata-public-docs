Cosdata is a cutting-edge vector database designed to tackle the complex challenges of modern search and retrieval. By combining semantic search capabilities with knowledge graphs and advanced AI technologies, Cosdata delivers a powerful platform for building intelligent data applications.

> **Open Source**: Cosdata is fully open-source and available on <a href="https://github.com/cosdata/cosdata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community!

## Tackling Modern Search Challenges

In today's data-rich environment, traditional keyword-based search methods are no longer sufficient. Organizations face several key challenges:

- **Data Explosion**: Managing and searching through massive amounts of structured and unstructured data
- **Context Understanding**: Moving beyond simple keyword matching to understand the meaning behind queries
- **Performance at Scale**: Maintaining speed and accuracy as data volumes grow exponentially
- **Integration Complexity**: Seamlessly connecting search capabilities with existing ML pipelines

Cosdata addresses these challenges with a next-generation vector database specifically designed for precision, speed, and scalability.

## Industry-Leading Performance

Independent benchmarks demonstrate Cosdata's exceptional performance characteristics:

<div class="performance-highlights">

- **1,773 Queries Per Second**: 43% faster than leading competitors
- **98.08% Recall@5 Accuracy**: With 0.98 precision
- **~3,000 QPS on 4-core Systems**: With optimized configurations

</div>

On standard hardware configurations, Cosdata consistently outperforms other vector databases in throughput while maintaining high search accuracy. Our optimized configurations can achieve nearly 3,000 queries per second on modest 4-core systems.

For detailed benchmark information, see our [Benchmarks](/features/benchmarks/) page.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Queries with Hybrid Search

Cosdata elevates search precision by leveraging hybrid search techniques that combine:

- **Dense Vector Search**: Captures semantic meaning through embeddings
- **Sparse Vector Search**: Maintains keyword importance similar to traditional search
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Provides deeper context by leveraging structured relationships

This hybrid approach delivers more relevant, context-rich results even for complex queries, making Cosdata ideal for powering advanced retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipelines.

### 2. Lightning-Fast Performance

When dealing with millions of queries or massive datasets, speed is critical. Cosdata delivers exceptional performance through:

- **HNSW Indexing**: Hierarchical Navigable Small World algorithms for efficient indexing of high-dimensional vector data
- **Smart Quantization**: Advanced compression techniques that maintain accuracy while reducing storage requirements
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threading and SIMD instructions for maximized performance

These optimizations ensure that Cosdata can handle high-throughput search operations with minimal latency, even at scale.

### 3. Streamlined Setup and Integration

Cosdata simplifies deployment and integration with:

- **Auto-configuration**: Automatic fine-tuning of search parameters for optimal performance
- **Intuitive APIs**: Simple RESTful APIs and client libraries for easy interaction
- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimized resource consumption without compromising performance

## Key Features

- **Semantic Search**: Leverage embedding-based hybrid search to deliver deep semantic analysis
- **Structured Knowledge Graphs**: Sophisticated context retrieval through structured knowledge representation
- **Hybrid Search Capabilities**: Combine explicit relationship queries with vector similarity search
- **Real-Time Search at Scale**: Execute real-time vector search with unmatched scalability
- **ML Pipeline Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with your existing machine learning workflows
- **Transactional Guarantees**: ACID-compliant operations for data consistency
- **Comprehensive Query Language**: Powerful Cos Graph Query Language for complex operations

# Search Relevance

Cosdata provides advanced search relevance capabilities to ensure your users find exactly what they're looking for.

## Hybrid Search

Enhance search precision with our vector database, leveraging the power of combined sparse and dense vector searches to deliver highly relevant, context-rich results for complex queries.

### How It Works

Hybrid search combines multiple search techniques:

1. **Dense Vector Search**: Uses embeddings to capture semantic meaning
2. **Sparse Vector Search**: Captures keyword importance similar to traditional search
3. **Combined Scoring**: Intelligently merges results for optimal relevance

## Knowledge Graph Integration

Improve the relevance of your search results by seamlessly combining structured information from knowledge graphs with the nuanced semantics of vector embedding, enabling our vector database to deliver richer and more relevant insights.

### Benefits

- Enhanced contextual understanding

# Performance

Cosdata is designed from the ground up for exceptional performance, even at scale.

## Benchmarks

Our benchmarks show that Cosdata outperforms traditional vector databases in several key metrics:

| Metric | Cosdata | Traditional DB | Improvement |
|--------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Query Latency (p95) | 15ms | 45ms | 3x faster |
| Indexing Speed | 100K vectors/s | 30K vectors/s | 3.3x faster |
| Memory Usage | 4GB | 12GB | 3x more efficient |

## Optimization Techniques

### HNSW Indexing

Cosdata uses Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs for approximate nearest neighbor search, providing:

- Logarithmic search complexity
- Configurable precision/speed tradeoff
- Efficient memory usage

### Parallel Processing

Cosdata leverages multi-threading and SIMD instructions to maximize performance:

- Parallel query processing
- Vectorized distance calculations
- Efficient memory access patterns

## Scaling Guidelines

For optimal performance as your data grows:

1. **Hardware Recommendations**:
   - 16+ CPU cores
   - 64GB+ RAM
   - NVMe SSD storage

2. **Configuration Tuning**:
   - Adjust HNSW parameters (M, efConstruction, efSearch)
   - Optimize batch sizes for your workload
   - Configure memory limits appropriately
